Fonts folder - NX+ Language

Place any custom font files you want to use in your NX+ projects here.

Supported font formats:
- .ttf (TrueType Font)
- .otf (OpenType Font)
- .woff / .woff2 (Web fonts)

After adding fonts here, you can import them in your NX+ code or website using their file names.

Example:
If you add "MyFont.ttf" here, you can reference it like:

FONT "MyFont.ttf"

Remember to respect font licenses when adding third-party fonts.

Enjoy customizing your NX+ projects!
