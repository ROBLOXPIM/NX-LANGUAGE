===========================

📌 What is this file?
This file explains how to properly use NX+ code examples.

📄 How to use .nxp files:
- NX+ code files must have the extension: `.nxp`
- If you're writing code in a text editor, it may save as `.txt` by default.
- To run your NX+ code, you must RENAME the file from `.txt` to `.nxp`

✅ Example:
  If your file is: mycode.txt  
  Rename it to:    mycode.nxp

🛠 How to run:
- Open any terminal or interpreter that supports NX+
- Run your `.nxp` script there
- You’ll now be able to execute and test your code!

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Files saved as `.txt` **will not run**
- You must use `.nxp` as the extension to make your code functional
